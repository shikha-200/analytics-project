## Background

### Problem Context
Bicycle theft is a persistent issue in urban areas, impacting both individual cyclists and city infrastructure. As cycling gains popularity as an environmentally friendly and cost-effective mode of transportation, the increasing rate of bicycle theft poses significant challenges for public safety and urban mobility. In cities like Toronto, where cycling is integrated into daily commuting and recreational activities, theft incidents not only result in financial losses but also discourage cycling as a viable transportation option.

Despite efforts by law enforcement and city planners, bicycle theft remains a widespread problem due to several factors, including insufficient secure parking infrastructure, lack of awareness among cyclists regarding theft prevention, and the presence of an active black market for stolen bicycles. Additionally, the effectiveness of theft prevention measures is often hindered by a lack of comprehensive data analysis and predictive insights that can help identify high-risk areas and time periods.

This report aims to bridge that gap by leveraging a dataset from the Toronto Police Service spanning 2013 to 2022 to analyze patterns in bicycle theft. By identifying spatial and temporal trends, highlighting high-theft neighborhoods, and understanding the characteristics of stolen bikes, this study provides valuable insights for both cyclists and law enforcement. Ultimately, the findings will support the development of targeted preventive measures, enhancing overall bicycle security in Toronto.

### Significance of the Study
Bicycle theft is a growing concern in urban areas, impacting both individual cyclists and broader transportation networks. As cities like Toronto promote cycling as a sustainable mode of transportation, addressing the issue of bicycle theft becomes crucial for ensuring public confidence and safety. This study is significant for several reasons:
1. Enhancing Theft Prevention Strategies: Helps law enforcement develop targeted anti-theft measures.
2. Empowering Cyclists: Provides data-driven insights to help cyclists secure their bikes.
3. Informing Urban Planning: Guides infrastructure improvements for safer bike parking.
4. Supporting Law Enforcement: Helps optimize patrol routes and theft recovery efforts.
5. Promoting Sustainable Mobility: Encourages cycling by reducing theft risks.

### Research Objectives
The primary objective of this study is to analyze bicycle theft patterns in Toronto using data-driven methodologies. Specific objectives include:
1. Identify Temporal Trends: Examine how bicycle theft incidents vary across different times of the day, days of the week, and seasons.
2. Analyze Spatial Distribution: Identify high-risk neighborhoods and theft hotspots in Toronto.
3. Examine Theft Patterns by Bike Type & Cost: Determine which types and price ranges of bicycles are most frequently stolen.
4. Assess Contributing Factors: Investigate factors influencing bicycle theft, such as location type, security measures, and weather conditions.
5. Develop Theft Prevention Strategies: Provide actionable recommendations for cyclists, law enforcement, and city planners to mitigate bicycle theft.
6. Support Policy & Infrastructure Planning: Offer insights to improve bike security infrastructure and urban planning initiatives.
