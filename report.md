# Understanding Bicycle Theft in Toronto: Trends, Risks, and Solutions

*By: Shikha Rani*

## Executive Summary
Bicycle theft is a significant issue in urban environments, particularly in cities like Toronto, where cycling is a common mode of transportation. The rising number of bicycle theft incidents poses challenges for cyclists, law enforcement, and urban planners. This study analyzes bicycle theft patterns in Toronto using a dataset from the Toronto Police Service spanning from 2013 to 2022. By employing data-driven methodologies, the study identifies key trends, high-risk areas, and factors contributing to bicycle theft.
Key objectives of the study include identifying temporal and spatial theft patterns, assessing the influence of bike type and cost, and providing recommendations for theft prevention. The insights generated can help law enforcement optimize patrols, assist city planners in designing secure bike parking facilities, and guide cyclists in making informed security choices.
